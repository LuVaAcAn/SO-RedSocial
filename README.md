# PowerPulse Sport Web Application Project üåü

## Summary
The project involves the development of a three-layer web application for a sports shoe store called PowerPulse Sport. The architecture is based on the three-layer model, which includes the data layer, application layer, and presentation layer, inspired by the structure of social networks.

### Data Layer
The data layer is implemented using **MongoDB** üçÉ, chosen for its scalability and flexibility in handling large volumes of unstructured data. This layer is responsible for storing all the information related to products, orders, and user accounts.

### Application Layer
The application layer is built with **NodeJS** üü¢, which offers an efficient and scalable environment for server-side operations. This layer handles the business logic, including user authentication, product management, order processing, and integration with the data layer.

### Presentation Layer
The focus of this project is on the presentation layer, which serves as the interface through which users interact with the application. This layer is designed following principles of usability and accessibility, using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** to create an attractive and user-friendly visual experience. Inspired by social network architecture, the interface allows users to navigate intuitively through the various sections of the store.

To facilitate the implementation and deployment of the application, **Docker** üê≥ containers are used. This ensures portability and consistency of the runtime environment, regardless of the underlying operating system. Since **Windows** has been selected as the primary operating system, configurations are optimized to ensure optimal performance.

## Project Goal üéØ
To develop a three-layer web application for the PowerPulse Sport store, implementing an architecture inspired by social networks, with an emphasis on the presentation layer. Docker containers and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap will be used to achieve an attractive and functional user interface.

## Conclusion üèÅ

### Enhanced User Experience
The presentation layer of PowerPulse Sport focuses on enhancing the user experience through features such as product exploration, purchase execution, and order tracking.

### Operating System Choice
The choice of **Windows** as the operating system is based on its compatibility with development tools, efficient support for Docker containers, and seamless integration with enterprise infrastructure, especially if it is based on Microsoft technologies.

### Strategic Use of Docker
The implementation of containers, particularly using Docker, is considered a strategic and effective decision. This choice offers benefits such as portability, consistency, development efficiency, scalability, and additional levels of isolation and security for the presentation layer.

### Comparison with Alternatives
When compared to alternatives like Kubernetes and Podman, Docker stands out for its robustness in terms of portability, scalability, ease of maintenance, and compatibility with cloud services, reinforcing its choice for the presentation layer.

### Technology Selection
The selection of specific technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS** with **EJS**, and **NodeJS** is justified by criteria such as ease of learning, seamless integration, performance, reactivity, extensive community support, additional tools, maintainability, and scalability. These advantages outweigh other options like React with Express.js and Angular with Node.js.

### Adoption of Bootstrap
The adoption of **Bootstrap** for styling the web application is supported by its ease of use, compatibility with different browsers, performance efficiency, and extensibility. These attributes significantly contribute to enhancing the visual aesthetics of the user interface, providing a dynamic and attractive experience.
